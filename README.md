ECS project analysing the NCSC dataset

This project was done in the Economics of Cyber Security (TPM020B) 23/24 Q1 course at TU Delft. The analysis of the NCSC dataset was done in terms of finding whether the time gap between vulnerabilities 
recorded in one database is substantial when compared to other databases, specifically the NVD and NCSC databases were considered. Also the identification and development of the methodology through which organisations can identify the vulnerabilities that need to be prioritised based on historical data consisting of the probability of occurrence and damage impact of that attack.

Due to data security constraints, we cannot share the NCSC dataset.
